**Question 1:** “Pestcouts” is an emerging pesticide (insect killer) research lab. They are aiming at producing environmental friendly pesticides. Currently they are conducting tests for a new formula on a farmhouse. They divided the farmhouse into 4 fields. They have conducted a test and record the success scores. Scores are sent to the system one by one and stored in a table as shown below. 

In the below data table, tests are being conducted in 4 fields. Each field corresponds to row and each test value corresponds to column of data. 

Field 1 Field 2 

|5 |1 |21 |-1 |-1 |-1 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
|-1 |-1 |-1 |-1 |-1 |-1 |
|23 |5 |20 |5 |30 |-1 |
|1 |9 |5 |0 |-1 |-1 |

Field 3 Field 4 

*Note: -1 shows that field is empty.* 

1. Insert a new value in any field of table at first empty location. 
1. Count the number of filled locations (values other than -1) in whole table 
1. Delete any filled value from any field. (Deletion means replace with -1) 
1. Find and display the top two values in whole data (excluding -1) which have maximum occurrences. For example, in given data table above, 5 has maximum occurrence of 4 times while 1 has second maximum occurrence of 2 times. 
1. Calculate Average test score of all the field values (excluding empty locations). 
1. Tell the field/s no having maximum success scores value
